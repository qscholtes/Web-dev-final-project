      <strong>Introduction: </strong>
      The primary focus of the website that I created is on the previous projects and initiatives that
      Doctors without Borders has taken for outbreaks or problem-zones. The structure that I took for the website
      is to give a brief overview of what DWB has done so far, and what their purpose is as a organization itself.
      To facilitate this I focused on a structure that did not have very large blocks of text but rather
      had short and concise blocks of texts with lots of media included. I wanted to keep the structure
      somewhat variable as well between websites to keep the end-user engaged therefore I decided to not
      have the exact identical layout for every webpage. In my own personal experience the websites that I consider
      successful have a good mix between content and media with a decent bit spacing between it, this
      allows the user to not become distracted from the primary focus of the content while still keeping them engaged.

    <div class="report">
      <strong>Inspiration:</strong>
      My first inspiration for the website that I have created is the DWB website itself, there is a lot of javascript
      that makes the website interactive, with effective use of white space and a basic yet effective choice of colors
      that keeps the website from going bland. The iconic red color of the organization inspired me to use a gradient
      for
      the background color uniformly on all the web pages and create the navbar in red too.
      <br>
      Another inspiration that I had for the website was The Odin Project, which is an open source free course where
      there are web sites
      given and the user has to style them in the form of a finished picture that is provided. I felt like they were
      able to
      open up my creative side and think outside of the box literally when it comes to the whole box method used for web
      pages.
      It is different to see proffesional websites and use them than to actually try to style the websites in a specific
      manner.
      <br>
      Lastly I was greatly inspired in the creation of my website going through the W3schools website and looking
      through all the different
      ways things can be created. There were countless times where I had to use external resources for help ,for example
      how to keep the
      navigation bar always on top even during scrolling, or the footer.
    </div>
    <div class="report">
      <strong>Accesibility: </strong>
      The website that I have created has multiple methods that were used to make it accessibile. Firstly I ensured that
      I used a simple
      navigation for the website itself. I created a navigation bar with white text on a red background that makes the
      links for the other
      pages easy to see. In addition to this I wanted to keep it simple so I made the font size of increase of whenever
      an item in the navbar
      is selected to help where people may possibly have eyesight issues.
      <br>
      Futhermore another way that I made the website accessible is by creating a fullscreen button on the top right of
      every page through
      javascript. This permits users with eyesight impairments to have a greater overview of the website as a whole.
      This is particularily useful
      for some of the images on the website that grow in size responsively to the size of the viewport of the user.
      <br>
      The third method I utilized to make the website more accessibile is to ensure that all the images have alt tags on
      this. This allows users
      with lack of eyesight to get an audible description of what is occuring in the images, and these can in turn also
      help the user understand
      the content of the page they are currently on.
    </div>
    <div class="report">
      <strong>Usability: </strong>
      The primary focus in terms of usability of the website was that I wanted there to a good overiew visibile of the
      website at all times.
      The navigation bar has to always be visible for when a user has scrolled through a web page, and the user always
      has the social media links
      visible at the bottom of the page for the organization that I chose. These aid in useability as they permit
      quicker navigation of the site without having
      to go look how to get to the next page.
      <br>
      Since the focus of our final project was to be responsive, I made efforts in regards to usability by trying to
      make content and the layout of the website
      responsive in reaction to the viewport size itself. This gave me the largest issue at hand because once you start
      having lots of different classes and ID's
      with multiple nested containers it can get difficult quickly to do this effectively. Doing this allows the website
      to be viewable on more than just
      a desktop with a large monitor size.
      <br>
      Additionally another method I used to aid in useability of the website was to keep a uniform color scheme among
      all the web pages in addition
      to a uniform navbar and footer. I did this in anattempt to keep the website uniform while still keeping the
      content and layout variable. This
      helps in usability so that they user doesnt have to relearn on every web page how to navigate through all the
      pages.
    </div>
    <div class="report">
      <strong> Learning:</strong>

      The largest thing I had to learn was how to get the sizing of boxes, images and content responsive. This becomes
      difficult quickly
      when you have many nested classes with items in it, with many of them having their own properties. In part I was
      able for some portions
      I used bootstrap for example with the big image banner on the main page, while with other parts I had to decrease
      the text size, or the size of
      a box of content when a viewport size threshold was reached. Trying to make the web page responsive in terms of
      content,
      layout, useability is and was by far the most challenging obstacle for me, and I was only able to achieve it
      partially.
      <br>
      Another focal point for learning for me was the layout of the website itself. While certain CSS properties like
      padding or margin are all easy
      to understand, placing content on the page itself exactly where and HOW you want it to is a different story,
      especially when there are other
      boxes you need to think relative to them and how the layout will change the perception of the website. I achieved
      this through using resources
      such as W3 schools and stackoverflow to get an idea of how other web pages are structured and nested to achieve
      their intended layout.
      <br>
      Finally another thing I had to learn in the process of creating my website was some of the javascript event
      listeners and how one should approach
      using them to create a responsive website. The lectures and videos in the course materials were quite well in
      going over all this, but as a first time
      javascript user and attempt at web development things can become overwhelming quickly. I achieved this through
      looking online how other people
      achieved certain responsive events with javascript in combination with resources like W3schools.

      <strong> Evaluation 1:</strong>

      Personally I think that the most succesful parts of the website I created are the navigation bar and footer. I
      believe these are succesful
      because the colors I used for them in addition to the styling give off a similar real life look of a website that
      the organization itself would also use.
      They are simple to use, easy to understand and see therefore they are effective. The addition of the scroll
      progress bar created with javascript
      complements the colors of the organizations logo too.
      Furthermore I think that the general idea of the layout of the website is good, there is no overabundance of text
      or an overflow of media that make the website
      too boring nor too wild in terms of visually.
    </div>
    <div class="report">
      <strong> Evaluation 2:</strong>

      As previously mentioned, one of the main areas that I can improve on is the layout of the website when there is a
      small viewport. I tried my best
      to get elements and content to align vertically when this occurs but I may have oversophisticated the whole
      process through too many different css
      properties in children of parent containers, and how these all interact with each other. If i do things
      differently another time I want to start off by
      creating multiple different mock-ups then try to visualize how I would set up the content in them, and in turn how
      I would resize them or reorder them for smaller
      viewports. Doing this whole website on my own in comparison to the mid-term really indicated the importance of a
      strong planning phase, and turning
      that planning phase into test pages before one complciates itself too much by starting with CSS and lableling
      content with ID's and Classes.
      It was a real eye-opener to me how in depth the functioning of a website can go with containerisation, what
      affects the containers have with each other,
      what the properties of the nested children will do and how difficult it can be to create effective websites with
      lots of different boxes of content. Inherently this also made me realize and understand that it can be a good idea
      in addition to the wireframes to also pre-plan names of containers/classes. I attempted to use the Boostrap
      framework
      for the project but after completing the website I realized that this was a mistake, there were CSS rules within
      Boostrap that
      conflicted with some of the CSS that I wanted to apply so i had to set !important to some rules.This may also have
      been
      due to my lack of experience with the inheriting of CSS styling from parent containers.

      <strong>Resources:</strong>
      <br>
      The tools that I used to create my website are VSC(code editor),Bootstrap,Slack for issues that I had, and
      Microsoft Word to create the wireframes.
